            The purpose of this problem is to recursively draw circles.
            Please follow the problems in the order shown!
            <br>
            This problem will have 5 parts. For each part, create a new function 
            with the specifications that are given. 
            <br>
            To test if each function works, create a main and call the function
            within it. The functions should work as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>draw_circle_1(100)</li>
                <li>draw_circle_2(100)</li>
                <li>draw_circle_rec(200, 5)</li>
                <li>alternate_colors(3)</li>
                <li>draw_circles_alternating(200, 5)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
        Part 1
        </h2>
        <div>
        Write a function called <em>draw_circle_1</em> that draws a single circle.
        <br>  
        It should take the circle's radius as a parameter. The precondition
        for this function is turtle's default state (facing east, pen down)
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Part 2</h2>
        <div>
        Write a function called <em>draw_circle_2</em> that draws the picture
        at a depth of 2.
        <br>
        This should use draw_circle_1 in its implementation, and also have the 
        circle's radius as a parameter.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Part 3</h2>
        <div>
            Write a function called <em>draw_circle_rec</em> that recursively
            draws the circles as shown in the picture.
            <br>
            This function should take a radius and a depth as parameters.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

    
        <h2>Part 4</h2>
        <div>
            Write a function called <em>alternate_colors</em> 
            that changes turtle's pencolor depending on the parameter 
            given.
            <br>
            This should take 1 parameter (depth), and depending on whether 
            depth is even or odd, change turtle's pencolor accordingly.
            <br>
            You can use any color of your choice (as long as it's visible).
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Part 5</h2>
        <div>
            Create a new function called <em>draw_circles_alternating</em> 
            that draws the circles alternating in color.
            <br>
            You can use copy and paste your recursive solution into this 
            function for this part. This function should take a depth and a 
            radius as parameters, and should draw the picture as shown in the 
            pitcure at the beginning of the document (with colors this time!)
